GN 2019:


Add comments to NemexA.


NOTE:

NemexA and NemexF vocabulary structures are the same but loading is slower for NemexF than for NemexA

Idea of NemexA and using it on texts:

When loading a new dictionary, create a POS analysis of the entries and infer regular patterns and lower and upper length bounds.

Then do POS tagging on text and then extract candidates on basis of dictionary fingerprints.
