I. How to Build NEMEX?

Please first install Maven. Then, in a terminal, change to the directory that contains the POM XML file and run the following command:

mvn assembly:assembly

mvn3 assembly:assembly on Mac OSX

This will produce a JAR file called nemex.jar, a WAR file called nemex.war as well as all the libraries (i.e. dependencies). 
They are also all packaged into one ZIP file called nemex-distribution.zip.

II. How to use NEMEX as a library?

If you add the above mentioned JAR file, called nemex.jar to the classpath, 
you would be able to use it as a library in your Java application.

III. How to use NEMEX as a standalone Java (J2SE) application?

Simply run the main classes such as de.dfki.lt.nemex.Main_NemexA.

IV. How to use NEMEX as a J2EE application?

Install Apache tomcat or a similar application server. 
Then, deploy the above mentioned WAR file, called nemex.war on the server. 
Now, by starting Tomcat up, the NEMEX J2EE web application should be ready to use from the web browser:

http://127.0.0.1:8080/nemex/


V. How to use NEMEX via XML-RPC?

XML-RPC is supported. A sample client is available at:

de.dfki.lt.nemex.Test_XML_RPC.java

--------------------------------------

A number of current limitations:

-Multiple concurrent users are not yet supported. Because, one user might unload a vocabulary which
is in use by another one and no concurrency support is implemented.
-Uploading users��� own vocabularies using the web-based UI is not yet possible.
