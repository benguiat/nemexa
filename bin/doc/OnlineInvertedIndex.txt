- to support online creation of a dictionary based in similarity lookup do:
	I think it can also handle string similarity join when used with threshold<= 1, 
	if I would keep a list of the similar strings.

- create empty dictionary with settings "0 utf-8 EN 0 0"

- Then, for a new entry, which is just a string + Type (which could also be a default) do:
	- do similarity lookup with threshold = 1
		- if no entry found
			- create entry
			- set frequency = 1
			- update dictionary general information
		- if entry found
			- if entry has Type
				- update frequency
				- update dictionary information
			- if entry does not has Type
				- entry Type information
				- set frequency = 1
				- update dictionary information
	
	- do similarity lookup with threshold = < 1
		- if no entry found
			- create entry
			- set frequency = 1
			- update dictionary general information
		- if entry found
			- entry will be a list of matching entries
			- the list is considered to be an equivalence class
			- define which of the entry should be the core entry 
				-> can I have multiple core entries ?
				-> is this the same as similarity join
			- insert core entry and delete the others
			- update dictionary  information
			
About dictionary entries:
- a dictionary is a hashmap of index:content
- content is: ["-9.197762", "abacterial#abdominoperineal", "NG:1:-9.197762", "NG:1:657"]
- if I have a new entry, it is of form
	entry=["abacterial#abdominoperineal", "NG"]


- in order to implement the above, I can create an IncrementelInvertedIndex class
- that performs the above steps for each new entry
	- it looks up entry in the current inverted index
	- and adds or updates the new entry
	- for existing entries, I will define generic methods for incremental update of the content of an entry
		- for updating a reading
		- I do this such that I can later change the format. Methods
			- find reading
			- update reading 
			- update absolute statistics
		
- the IncrementelInvertedIndex can then be used in a different controller, e.g., for clustering or building a dictionary
	from a text stream of text fragments
